# Automate-an-E-Commerce-Web-Application



DESCRIPTION

To automate a real-world web application

 

<h2>Description:</h2>

Flipkart is an e-commerce platform, and they have launched a new feature to search for a product in a particular category. Once the product is searched, Flipkart displays it as a list of product items. To enhance the performance of the application, Flipkart has implemented lazy loading. It displays only a few products that can come on the screen.

To display or load more products, the user must scroll down.

As a Test Engineer, you are expected to test this feature end-to-end.

 

<h2>Detailed Scenario:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Navigate to the Flipkart homepage (https://www.flipkart.com/)</li>
<li>Determine a page load time with a performance test</li>
<li>Search for a product, say, “iPhone 13” under the “Mobile” category</li>
<li>Check if the images are loaded and visible till the screen height only</li>
<li>Check if the page has a scroll feature</li>
<li>Check the frequency at which the content will be refreshed while scrolling</li>
<li>Verify that the image is downloaded just before the user scrolls to its position and gets displayed in time</li>
<li>Verify that it navigates to the bottom of the page</li>
<li>Check whether different browsers and screen resolutions render it the same way</li>
</ul>
